## Receive tokens from an exchange

1. Purchase your tokens on [an exchange that lists Luna](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/terra-luna-v2/markets/).

2. Withdraw any token supported by Station from your exchange. Every exchange will be different and you should visit the web page of their preferred exchange for details on how to withdraw tokens. Use the following steps as a generic guide.

   1. To receive tokens to your wallet, use your wallet address. To copy your wallet address, just click on the name of your wallet in the upper right-hand corner of the app and click on **COPY** just below the address. Your wallet address will take the following form: `terra<random-numbers-and-letters>`. Note, the prefix will differ if you are sending assets form a different Station-supported chain.

   2. Double-check that your submitted address matches the address of the wallet where you would like to receive funds.

   3. Send the tokens from the exchange to your Station wallet address.

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Transfer wait times">

When you transfer tokens from an exchange, it will take some time for the tokens to appear in your wallet. Don't panic. This waiting period is normal and varies depending on the exchange. If a transfer does not appear immediately, check back after some time.

## Manual Staking

Stake your Luna to a validator of your choice to start earning rewards.

1. Open the Station desktop app and navigate to the **Stake** page.

2. Click **Manual Stake** and select a Validator and click on their name in the **Moniker** column of the validator list.

<img className="readme-img-lg" src="/img/screens/desktop/stake-page.png" />

3. In the **My delegations** section, click **Delegate**. A new window will appear.

<img className="readme-img-sm" src="/img/screens/desktop/stake-validator.png" />

4. In the **Amount** field, specify the amount of Luna you want to delegate.

<img className="readme-img-lg" src="/img/screens/desktop/stake-delegate.png" />

<Admonition type="caution" icon="☢️" title="Maintain funds for transaction fees">

It is recommended to maintain some funds in your wallet for future transactions. Without available capital for fee payment, you will not be able to carry out further transactions until more tokens are transferred to your wallet.

</Admonition>

5. Double-check the amounts and fees, enter your password, and click **Submit**.

Congratulations, you've just delegated Luna!

## Quick Staking

Quick staking chooses validators to stake to on your behalf that meet the following criteria:

- Bottom 65% of the validator set by voting power
- No slashes in last 1,200,000 blocks
- Commission of 5% or less

To quick stake, follow the steps outlines above but select **Quick Stake** on the **Stake Page**. This will skip the step of having to manually select a validator.

<Admonition type="info" icon="💡" title="Quick stake validators">
Delegations of 100 or less will be delegated to 1 validators.
Delegations of 1000 or less will be split among 2 validators.
Delegations of 10,000 or less will be split among 4 validators.
Delegations of 10,000 or more will be split among 5 validators.

</Admonition>

The quick undelegation functionality considers your current delegations and undelegates from them in order from most to least voting power until your desired token amount is met.

## Staking other native assets

You can stake tokens on other networks supported by Station by selecting a different chain on the staking page. Once you've selected your desired chain, follow the steps above.

## Withdraw staking rewards

Rewards start accruing the moment you stake. Monitor your rewards in the staking section of Station. Once you have sufficient rewards, follow the steps below to withdraw them.

1. Open Station and click **Stake**.

2. To claim all rewards, click **Withdraw all rewards** in the upper right corner of the staking page. To withdraw rewards from a single validator, click on **Manual stake**, select their name in the Validators list and click **Withdraw rewards** on the Validator details page.

<img className="readme-img-lg" src="/img/screens/desktop/stake-page.png" />

3. Review the amount, enter your password, and click **Submit**.
